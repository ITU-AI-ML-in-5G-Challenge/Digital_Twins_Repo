# Evolution and Blockchain: An Autonomous Network Architecture PoC
This repository contains the code, [report](Final_Report_Digital_Twins_Build_a_thon.pdf), [slides](Presentation-Digital-Twins.pptx) and [demo video](#demo) of Team Digital Twins' submission to the 2022 AI/ML in 5G Challenge. We present a Proof of Concept (PoC) of the decentralized controller evolution architecture for Autonomous Networks (AN) using a distributed Marketplace.

## Introduction
With this project, we aim to solve the problem of ensuring security, traceability and trust in the evolution of controllers in AN. To this end, we have developed a fully decentralized Marketplace that registers, stores and protects evolution artifacts in a way that is fully auditable, and secure. This has been achieved through the use of IPFS and a private Ethereum blockchain. For more details, [check out our report here](Final_Report_Digital_Twins_Build_a_thon.pdf).

## Demo

You can find a video demo of this project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RcLGaupZk4i-S_hT8INUxz5pNFhPREmd/view?usp=sharing).


## Reproduction

### Pre-requisites
* Docker Engine and Docker Compose: `https://www.docker.com/get-started/`

### Quick-start

To start the network run the following command in your terminal from the working directory:
```sh
docker compose up -d
```
> **Note** The -d parameter in the previous command runs each container in the background. To display the logs of the entire network you can run:
> ```sh
> docker compose logs -f 
> ```
> or for a specific container:
> ```sh
> docker compose logs -f <my-container>
> ```

To stop the network and remove the containers run: 

```sh
docker compose down
```

> **Note** Once deployed, you can gain access the uploaded artifacts on your browser by accessing the IPFS HTTP API of each node. 
> 
> For instance, you could connect to the HTTP API for the Evolution Controller node in your browser with the url http://0.0.0.0:8080/ipfs/ + **< your-file-cid >**
> The different port mappings for each node are listed below: 
> * Evol_Ctr: 8080
> * Exp_Mg: 8091
> * DT: 8092
> * Cur_Ctr: 8093




## Troubleshooting
The following is a list of useful commands to run for troubleshooting or solving issues while building the project:
* Clear docker's build cache:
```sh
docker builder prune -a
```
* Remove the images of each container in the network:
```sh
bash ./clean.sh
```
* List all containers (running or not):
```sh
docker ps -a
```
* Remove all stopped containers:
```sh
docker container prune 
```
